# Accordion Component in React

This Accordion component is built using React, showcasing some key React concepts and best practices.

## Key React Concepts Used

1. Use of children props  
   Implemented in the Accordion component on lines 29-30, allowing flexibility in passing content dynamically.

2. Ternary Operators for Conditional Rendering  
   Used for toggling classes based on state, enabling dynamic styling and behavior changes.

3. Passing Props and Managing State  
   Props are passed down to the Accordion component, and internal state is managed to control its open/close functionality.

4. Rendering Data from External Array of Objects  
   The Accordion component dynamically renders data sourced from an external array of objects, making it scalable and flexible for different datasets.
